For Linux 32/64 bit system
 We are providing the program as a executable named as 'cubt'. 
 This executable code as well as the input gene sequence file (in FASTA format) 
 are required to be in same directory. To run this program:
 Step 1: Type ./cubt in the command prompt($) of your terminal
 Step 2: Enter the input file name, when the program ask for the same. 
 Step 3: The output file containg all the measures of CUB will be created 
         as a .csv file. The .csv file can be viewed in any text editor/Microsoft Excel.
