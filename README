BUC project using the popPhyl dataset.

each directory contains two output files: describing statistics for each loci and summarizing statistics for the whole species

the "final_output.txt" file contains 83 statistics measured for 103 species:
	dataset: name of the directory
	NCBIname: NCBI names corresponding to the investigated species
	nLoci: number of retained loci (= contigs)
	Ltot: length of the coding frame for each loci
	GCtot: %GC for each loci
	GC12: %GC at positions 1 and 2 for each loci
	GC3: %GC at third position for each loci
	GCutr: %GC in UTR regions for each loci

	_avg = average from the observed loci
	_std = standard deviation over the observed loci

	r_ = Pearson's correlation coefficient
	rho_ = Spearman's correlation coefficient
	tau_ = Kendall's correlation coefficient

	nCountedReads = mean number of mapped reads for each expressed loci
	CorrectedExpression = mean number of mapped reads corrected by the %GC at positions 1 and 2

	NcJN = Effective number of codons; estimated by using John Novembre's code ENCprime (ENc)
	NcpJN = Effective number of codons by accounting for background nucleotide composition; estimated by using "ENCprime" (ENc')
	ENccubt = ENc calculated by using Satapathy and Sahoo's code "cub"
	ENcPcubt = ENc' calculated by using Satapathy and Sahoo's code "cub" (ENc')
	ENcFDScubt = ENc calculated for amino acids having 4 synonymous codons. Values range from 8 to 32; estimated by using "cub"
	ENcPFDScubt = ENc' calculated for amino acids having 4 synonymous codons. Values range from 8 to 32; estimated by using "cub"
	Umcubt = Um(g) is an estimation of nucleotide frequency at 4 fould-fold degenerated sites
