BUC project using the popPhyl dataset.


each directory contains two output files:
	*/output_summarized.txt: describes statistics measured for each loci.
	*/output_final_2.txt: contains averaged statistics found in output_summarized.txt, and correlations between some pairs of statistics.
 

The "./final_output.txt" file contains 83 statistics measured for 103 species.
Can be read in R as follows: x = read.table("final_output.txt", h=T, sep="\t")
Contains:
	dataset: name of the directory
	NCBIname: NCBI names corresponding to the investigated species

	nLoci: number of retained loci (= contigs)
	Ltot: length of the coding frame for each loci

	GCtot: %GC for each loci
	GC12: %GC at positions 1 and 2 for each loci
	GC3: %GC at third position for each loci
	GCutr: %GC in UTR regions for each loci (utr3 and utr3: %GC if more than 20 nucl at the UTR3 and UTR5 positions respectively. utr if more than 20 nucl after concatenating UTR3 + UTR5

	_avg = average from the observed loci
	_std = standard deviation over the observed loci

	r_ = Pearson's correlation coefficient
	rho_ = Spearman's correlation coefficient
	tau_ = Kendall's correlation coefficient

	nCountedReads = mean number of mapped reads for each expressed loci
	CorrectedExpression = mean number of mapped reads corrected by the %GC at positions 1 and 2

	NcJN = Effective number of codons; estimated by using John Novembre's code ENCprime (ENc)
	NcpJN = Effective number of codons by accounting for background nucleotide composition; estimated by using "ENCprime" (ENc')
	ENccubt = ENc calculated by using Satapathy and Sahoo's code "cub"
	ENcPcubt = ENc' calculated by using "cub" (ENc')
	ENcFDScubt = ENc calculated for amino acids having 4 synonymous codons. Values range from 8 to 32; estimated by using "cub"
	ENcPFDScubt = ENc' calculated for amino acids having 4 synonymous codons. Values range from 8 to 32; estimated by using "cub"
	Umcubt = Um(g) is an estimation of nucleotide frequency at 4 fould-fold degenerated sites
